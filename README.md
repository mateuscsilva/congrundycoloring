# BRKGA, Local Search, Formulations and connecting algorithm for the paper The connected Grundy coloring problem: Formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm

## This project implements a biased random-key genetic algorithm with a local search procedure (BRKGA) and integer programming formulations for the Connected Grundy coloring problem and the Grundy coloring problem used in the paper The connected Grundy coloring problem: Formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm

The BRKGA code for the problem was developed using the [brkgaApi](https://github.com/rfrancotoso/brkgaAPI) framework. 

### Organization

1. brkga: folder that contains the codes related to brkga and the local search in C++.
2. src: folder that contains the codes related to the IP formulations in Julia.
3. instances.zip: compressed folder that contains the set of instances used in the experiments.
