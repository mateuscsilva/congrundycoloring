# Intances and detailed results for the paper The connected Grundy coloring problem: Formulations and a local-search enhanced biased random-key genetic algorithm

The paper is available on [Computers & Operations Research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2025.107136).

## Organization

1. instances.zip: compressed folder that contains the set of instances used in the experiments.
2. Detailed_online_supplements.pdf: detailed results for the benchmark instances in the appendix of the paper.

#### Observation

The instances of the complement of bipartite graphs were generated from the bipartite graphs and therefore preserve the header of the original, as well as the instances that were not connected. Some have already been updated, but we encourage you to read the instances until the end of file, while not all have their number of edges updated in the instance header.
